Hi, my name is Radek.

I'm open to all interesting projects, so if there is something I can help you with, don't hesitate to contact me.

A little about me:
- Java developer with experience in various projects, responsible for communication with customers, capable of bearing responsibility for technical solutions, and able to lead a team.
- I'm not a master in all technologies, but I'm able to quickly learn what we will need to successfully finish our project.
- Real experiences with various IT technologies and a hard theoretical base give me an efficient tool to solve miscellaneous projects and tasks.
